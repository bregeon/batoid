API changes
-----------
- Eliminated in-place methods like traceInPlace(), reflectInPlace(), ...
  Remaining operations on Ray and RayVector (e.g., trace(), reflect(), ...) are
  now done in place.  A new idiom for performing operations not-in-place is to
  first make a copy.  E.g., r2 = optic.trace(r1.copy())
- Eliminate trace methods traceReverse and traceSplitReverse by merging them
  into trace, traceSplit
- Changed output format of traceSplit to separate different paths through the
  optics.

New Features
------------
- Added `path` kwarg to trace and traceFull to trace a non-default path through
  the optics, e.g., to trace ghost images.
